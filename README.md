## Closet Archive

[closet-archive.vercel.app](https://closet-archive.vercel.app/)

A web app to digitally organize your wardrobe by uploading images of your clothes  
Users may create an account with an email address to get access to their own closet  
Background images are removed with [imgly/background-removal.js](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js)

Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Recoil  
Since I am using the free version of Supabase, this project will unfortunately become paused after 1 week of inactivity
